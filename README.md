Reservation Calendar Master
=================

Description
-----------

In this assignment I have implemented calendar functionality that keeps track of reservations for a single room. The backend API I have used is provided in this repository and will keep track of who has the room for which day. 
The application have the two main functionalities: adding a tenant to a day, removing a tenant from a day.


Getting Started
---------------

Install the package dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```
Once the dependancies are installed, you can start the application server by running

```
npm start
```
Once the server is running, you can start making requests to http://localhost:3000.


Application will be up and running on the address http://localhost:3000.
